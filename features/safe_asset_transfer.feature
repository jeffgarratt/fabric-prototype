Feature: Safe Asset Transfer
  As a blockchain user
  I want to bootstrap a new blockchain network and demonstrate safe asset transfer

  #  1. Bob (or Alice) creates channel-1
  #  2. Bob joins channel-1.
  #  3. Alice joins channel-1.
  #  4. Alice (or Bob) instantiates chaincode "asset-transfer" in channel-1 with endorsement policy "BobOrg AND AliceOrg".
  #  5. Bob creates foo.
  #  6. Bob transfers foo to Alice.
  #  7. Carol (or Alice) creates channel-2.
  #  8. Alice joins channel-2.
  #  9. Dan (escrow) joins channel-1.
  #  10. Dan joins channel-2.
  #  Everyone installs again with updated version 1.1
  #  then send new 'upgrade' (exactly the same as instantiate) with new policy
  #  11. In channel-1, Alice updates chaincode by modifying endorsement policy to "DanOrg AND (BobOrg OR AliceOrg)".
  #  12. In channel-2, Alice instantiates chaincode "asset-transfer" with endorsement policy "DanOrg AND (CarolOrg OR AliceOrg)".
  #  13. In channel-1, Alice locks foo to channel-2.
  #  14. In channel-2, Dan (or Alice) shows foo from channel-1.
  #  15. In channel-2, Alice transfers foo to Carol.

  Scenario Outline: Bootstrap a development network with 4 peers (2 orgs)  and 1 orderer (1 org), each having a single independent root of trust (No fabric-ca, just openssl)
    #creates 1 self-signed key/cert pair per orderer organization
    Given the orderer network has organizations:
      | Organization | Readers | Writers | Admins |
      | ordererOrg0  | member  | member  | admin  |
      | ordererOrg1  | member  | member  | admin  |

    And user requests role of orderer admin by creating a key and csr for orderer and acquires signed certificate from organization:
      | User                   | Orderer     | Organization | AliasSavedUnder   |
      | orderer0Signer         | orderer0    | ordererOrg0  |                   |
      | orderer1Signer         | orderer1    | ordererOrg0  |                   |
      | orderer2Signer         | orderer2    | ordererOrg1  |                   |
      | orderer0Admin          | orderer0    | ordererOrg0  |                   |
      | orderer1Admin          | orderer1    | ordererOrg0  |                   |
      | orderer2Admin          | orderer2    | ordererOrg1  |                   |
      | configAdminOrdererOrg0 | configAdmin | ordererOrg0  | config-admin-cert |
      | configAdminOrdererOrg1 | configAdmin | ordererOrg1  | config-admin-cert |


    # Rolenames : MspPrincipal.proto
    And the peer network has organizations:
      | Organization | Readers | Writers | Admins |
      | bobOrg       | member  | member  | admin  |
      | aliceOrg     | member  | member  | admin  |
      | carolOrg     | member  | member  | admin  |
      | danOrg       | member  | member  | admin  |



    And a ordererBootstrapAdmin is identified and given access to all public certificates and orderer node info

    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin creates a cert alias "bootstrapCertAlias" for orderer network bootstrap purposes for organizations
      | Organization |
      | ordererOrg0  |

    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin generates a GUUID to identify the orderer system chain and refer to it by name as "ordererSystemChannelId"

    # We now have an orderer network with NO peers.  Now need to configure and start the peer network
    # This can be currently automated through folder creation of the proper form and placing PEMs.
    And user requests role for peer by creating a key and csr for peer and acquires signed certificate from organization:
      | User                | Peer        | Organization | AliasSavedUnder   |

    # Order info includes orderer admin/orderer information and address (host:port) from previous steps
    # Only the peer organizations can vary.
    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin using cert alias "bootstrapCertAlias" creates the genesis block "ordererGenesisBlock" for chain "ordererSystemChannelId" for composition "<ComposeFile>" and consensus "<ConsensusType>" with consortiums modification policy "/Channel/Orderer/Admins" using consortiums:
      | Consortium |
#      | consortium1 |


    And the orderer admins inspect and approve the genesis block for chain "ordererSystemChannelId"

    # to be used for setting the orderer genesis block path parameter in composition
    And the orderer admins use the genesis block for chain "ordererSystemChannelId" to configure orderers

    And we compose "<ComposeFile>"

#    And I stop

    # Sleep as to allow system up time
    And I wait "<SystemUpWaitTime>" seconds

    Given user "ordererBootstrapAdmin" gives "ordererSystemChannelId" to user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" who saves it as "ordererSystemChannelId"
    And user "ordererBootstrapAdmin" gives "ordererGenesisBlock" to user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" who saves it as "ordererGenesisBlock"

    And the orderer config admin "configAdminOrdererOrg0" creates a consortium "consortium1" with modification policy "/Channel/Orderer/Admins" for peer orgs who wish to form a network:

    And the orderer config admin "configAdminOrdererOrg0" creates a consortiums config update "consortiumsConfigUpdate1" using config "latestOrdererConfig" using orderer system channel ID "ordererSystemChannelId" to add consortiums:
      | Consortium  |
      | consortium1 |

    And the user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" creates a configUpdateEnvelope "consortiumsConfigUpdate1Envelope" using configUpdate "consortiumsConfigUpdate1"

    And the user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" collects signatures for ConfigUpdateEnvelope "consortiumsConfigUpdate1Envelope" from developers:
      | Developer              | Cert Alias        |
      | configAdminOrdererOrg0 | config-admin-cert |
      | configAdminOrdererOrg1 | config-admin-cert |

    And the user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" creates a ConfigUpdate Tx "consortiumsConfigUpdateTx1" using cert alias "config-admin-cert" using signed ConfigUpdateEnvelope "consortiumsConfigUpdate1Envelope"

    And the user "configAdminOrdererOrg0" using cert alias "config-admin-cert" broadcasts ConfigUpdate Tx "consortiumsConfigUpdateTx1" to orderer "<orderer0>"


    Given the following application developers are defined for peer organizations and each saves their cert as alias

    And I wait "<BroadcastWaitTime>" seconds

    And user "alice" sends deliver a seek request on orderer "<orderer0>" with properties:
      | ChainId                           | Start | End |
      | com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.channel2 | 3     | 3   |

    Then user "alice" should get a delivery "deliveredShowTx1Block" from "<orderer0>" of "1" blocks with "1" messages within "1" seconds
